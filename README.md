# AlgoScope

AlgoScope is a web-based tool built with Next.js and TypeScript, designed to help users visualize and analyze sorting algorithms. The platform provides an interactive environment for understanding the behavior of Bubble Sort and Selection Sort algorithms, with a focus on measuring and comparing sorting times.

## Features
- Algorithm Visualization: Animated step-by-step visualizations of Bubble Sort and Selection Sort.
- Performance Metrics: Real-time tracking of sorting time to evaluate algorithm efficiency.
- Interactive Interface: Input custom data sets and observe sorting performance.
- Randomized Bar Graph: Generate randomized data sets for sorting algorithms to test performance on different scenarios.
